              You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

      Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

      If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

 

      121 become 144
      625  become 676
      114 become -1, since 114 is not a perfect, square

      function findNextSquare(sq) {
        var number = Math.sqrt(sq);
        if (Math.round(number) === number) {
          return Math.pow(++number, 2);
        }
        return -1;

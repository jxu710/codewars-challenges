        Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example:

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] -> "found the needle at position 5" 
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

*/

      function findNeedle(haystack) {
        return `found the needle at position ${haystack.indexOf("needle")}`;
      }
    </script>
